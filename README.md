# 213_THE2
The second big programing assignment of the course data structures. There are three main parts. BST, Trie and Movie. The 
Bst and Trie parts are the basis of the project. With Bst, I store the data; with Trie, I store the users and access efficiently.
The Movie part uses both and optimizes the organization.
